# gnome_settings

Use `dconf` to apply desired user interface gnome_settings. Currently, this role sets the following
options:

- Enables the 'Night Light' feature.
- Removes old trash and temporary files after 14 days
- Blanks the screen after 8 minutes
- Locks the screen after 30 minutes
- Uses 'AM/PM' rather than a 24-hour clock.
- Include minimize, resize, and maximize buttons in the application window.

## Requirements

Requires `python3-psutil`. This package is installed as a 'layered' package in the
`layered_packages` role.

Modules used:

- [ansible.builtin.stat](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/stat_module.html)
- [ansible.builtin.debug](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html)

- [ansible.builtin.command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/command_module.html)

## Role Variables

These varables are set in the project's `group_vars/all` file. Make your edits there!

- dconf_settings: These settings consist of a `dconf key` and the key's associated `value`.

You can identify other settings you may want to use by entering `dconf watch /` in a terminal,
and then making your desired changes. As you make changes, any dconf value changes will be
reflected in the terminal output.
